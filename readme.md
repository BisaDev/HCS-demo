# Human Care Systems code challenge

This is my submit for the challenge. Feel free to ignore any other file structure you may encounter. I used my boilerplate you get me started.

## Installation

```python
After downloading the repo 
$ npm i
Change the inputData.txt file to a location that's easy to find like Download (where you place it is entirely up to you)
You need to make sure you change the .env with an example path provided on the FILE_LOCATION value

Once done you either start with npm run test to run the automated tests.

This server uses Mongo Atlas and it's preconfigured on the .env. You could also use a GUI like compass to follow the changes
on the schema and collections.
